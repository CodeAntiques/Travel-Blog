                    The other winning bidders were California-based Masten Space Systems and Tokyo-based ispace, along with its European subsidiary.

                    Facebook disputed the allegations, but said it was co-operating with the department.

                    The lawsuit concerns Facebook's use of temporary H-1B visas, which are often used by tech companies to bring highly skilled foreign workers to the US.

                    In its lawsuit, filed on Thursday, the department alleged that Facebook "intentionally created a hiring system" that favoured H-1B visa holders and other temporary workers over Americans.</p>

                    In a statement, the sanctuary said Ms Crouser was hurt after Kimba, a male tiger rescued from Guatemala, bit her.

                    She broke protocols by sticking her hand into his cage, it added.

                    Ms Crouser, who had been with the sanctuary for five years, had arrived for feeding to find that the tiger was "locked in a section that was away from where he was usually fed", the statement said.

                    After reaching inside to unlatch a door, the tiger "grabbed her arm and nearly tore it off at the shoulder".

                    The statement added: "Candy said she just wasn't thinking when she reached in to un-clip it [the door]."</p>
